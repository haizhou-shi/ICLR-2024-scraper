# ICLR-2024-scraper
A simple (and naive) implementation of the ICLR 2024 scraper, inspired by the amazing repo of [OpenReviewExplorer](https://github.com/Chillee/OpenReviewExplorer/tree/master).

The scraped result (Title, Href, Keywords, Abstract) can be directly downloaded from this [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QwDwAoZXbdAJNJ5q4GcmDG8DUnZmXQdi?usp=sharing).
